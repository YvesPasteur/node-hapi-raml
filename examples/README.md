Simple Example
====

This example creates a single route (/simple).

We use a fake Hapi because otherwise Hapi would become a dependency of this library.

Basic Auth Example
====

This example creates a single route (/simple) that is secured by a Basic Auth strategy.

This expects a real instance of Hapi, so copy this example out somewhere and install.
